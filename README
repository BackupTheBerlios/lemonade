See: Lemon Parser Tutorial

"Lemon is a compact, thread safe, well-tested parser generator
written by D. Richard Hipp. Using a parser generator, along with
a scanner like flex, can be advantageous because there is less
code to write. You just write the grammar for the parser. This
article is an introduction to the Lemon Parser, complete with
examples. "

Usage with a lexer e.g. RE2C.


For building lemonade use your favorite c compiler e.g. gcc

gcc -o lemonade lemonade.c


Tested with:

 * gcc (GCC) 4.1.2 (Ubuntu 4.1.2-0ubuntu4)
 * dmc for windows from digitalmars.com



Modifcation:
------------

The %extra_argument directive instructs Lemonade to add parameter named 2extra" to the parsers
main structure and is within the grammar rules accessible.
